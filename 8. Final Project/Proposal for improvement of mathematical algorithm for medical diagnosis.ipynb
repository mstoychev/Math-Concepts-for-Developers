    "This chapter introduces the different backgrounds and motivations to develop this final project.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bone fractures** are a major public health problem. Hip fracture is one of the most important causes of morbidity and mortality in elderly patients and is a challenge for health systems worldwide, both due to its frequency and its high economic cost. In the United States of America alone, it is estimated that 200.000 hip fractures will occur annually at a cost of billions of dollars and it is expected that by 2040 the problem will triple. **[1,2]**\n",
    "\n",
    "Early identification of patients at higher risk of suffering a fracture is essential to prevent its occurrence. \n",
    "To do this, different tools are designed based on mathematical algorithms to assess the risk of fracture that feed different patient data. For example, *FRAX®*, *QFracture®*, Canadian Osteoporosis Society, the Nguyen algorithm, and the Dutch algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Osteoporosis** weakens bones to the point that they can break easily. It is called a “silent disease” because people who develop it may not notice any changes until a bone breaks — usually a bone in the hip, spine, or wrist. While people of all races and ethnic groups can develop osteoporosis, certain groups are more likely to develop the disease. \n",
    "It is a disease linked to aging, which affects about one in five women and one in twenty men, over age of 50.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bone Mineral Density(BMD)** is used as an **indirect indicator** of osteoporosis and fracture risk. BDM is the amount of bone mineral in bone tissue. The concept is of mass of mineral per volume of bone (relating to density in the physics sense), although clinically it is measured by proxy according to optical density per square centimetre of bone surface upon imaging. The most commonly used BMD test is called a **central dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry**(**DXA**). Bone mineral density could help prevent fractures, allowing the diagnosis of osteoporosis before a fracture event occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, The imperfect capture of risk with BMD alone poses several problems for the clinical assessment of fracture risk.\n",
    "The performance characteristics of the test are less than optimal in terms of the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity \n",
    "The osteoporotic fractures affect a substantial minority of the population, so based only on BDM detection, sensivity is low. \n",
    "For example, the annual incidence of hip fracture increases approximately 30 times between the ages of 50 and 90, however considering only the bone mineral density basis, studies expect an increase of only 4 times. **[3]**\n",
    "Another big disadvantage of BMD is its high cost. There are many countries that currently do not have such a device widely distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the difficulties presented by the BMD determination test itself, other tools emerge considering more independent risk factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main objective of this work is try to improve the *FRAX* tool, increasing its probability accuracy through an algorithm that analyzes a series of additional radiographs of patients."

    "#### 2.1. What is Frax? ####\n",
    "The Fracture Risk Assesment Tool (*FRAX*) is a mathematical algorithm, which was developed by Kanis and others at the University of Sheffield with the sponsorship of World **Health Organization (WHO)**, in order to assess the risk in patients of suffering a fracture. \n",
    "*FRAX* is an *on-line* tool which calculates risk of fracture from a number of clinical risk factors, whether bone mineral density is known or not. It´s probably the most internationally recognized method for determining the fracture risk, thanks to the quality of the data used on its methodology and calculations. \n",
    "\n",
    "This *FRAX* model has been validated in 11 study cohorts across the world. The aplication computes the probability of hip fracture and of the most important osteoporotic fractures at a 10-year view (spinal, forearm, shoulder, or hip clinic).\n",
    "\n",
    "*FRAX*  is not an infallible tool and it does have its **limitations**. It should be noted that the Body Mineral Density is not a precious method for predicting osteoporotic fractures, but *FRAX* works better if the BMD is known. Other example, could be the **Body Mass Index** $ BMI = \\frac{mass(kg)} {height(m)^2} $ may be altered patients with high muscular development(BMI increases, the risk may be overestimated) or by decreased height in patients with vertebral fractures. In these patients, the risk may be underestimated (the worst possible scenario). "

    "*FRAX* counts with different risk factors for calculate the individual´s probability of hip fracture or osteoporotic fracture.\n",
    "In the process of determining an individual's probability of fracture, the FRAX tool takes into account different risk indicators.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Bone mineral density (BMD)\n",
    "\n",
    "Bone mineral density, as a risk factor of the FRAX algorithm, is evaluated in the *femoral neck* by DXA, but\n",
    "there are a few cohort studies where DXA was used on the *distal forearm*. As mentioned in the previous section, FRAX may or may not count on the BMD value. To measure this variable is used the **T-Score**, according to the World Health Organization. This score indicates the the amount in **standard deviations(SD)** that the subject varies from the young adult mean.\n",
    "The following table details the DS for T-Score criteria for the diagnosis of osteoporosis according to the WHO.\n",

    "<h6><center> Table 1. Diagnostic criteria for osteoporosis according to T-Score </center></h6>\n",
    "\n",
    "As previously mentioned, having BMD alone is insufficient to identify all individuals at risk of fracture, since these fractures affect a minority of the population (low sensitivity). On the other hand, it should be noted that obtaining a T-Score > 1,5 SD not imply a guarantee of not suffering a fracture. Therefore, to better estimate risk there is a need to use more risk factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Age\n",
    "\n",
    "The model accepts ages between 40 and 90 years. If ages below or above are entered, the programme will compute probabilities at 40 and 90 year, respectively. The increase in risk with increasing age can vary up to 4 times when compared to BMD alone**[3]**.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Sex\n",

    "6. BMI\n",
    "\n",
    "The patient does not have to calculate it manually, the algorithm does it automatically. It is expressed in 𝑘𝑔/𝑚2. At one end a low BMI leads to a higher probability of a fracture and in the other obesity is not protective against fracture in postmenopausal women and increases the risk of fracture at some sites.**[4]**\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Previous fracture\n",
    "\n",
    "It´s binary factor, yes or not. A previous fracture denotes more accurately a previous fracture in adult life occurring spontaneously, or a fracture arising from trauma which, in a healthy individual, would not have resulted in a fracture.\n",

    "\n",
    "7. Parent fractured hip\n",

    "A parental history of fracture was associated with a modest but significantly increased risk of any fracture, osteoporotic fracture and hip fracture in men and women combined. **[5]**\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Current smoking\n",
    "\n",
    "It´s binary factor, yes or not depending on whether the patient currently smokes tobacco. It is known that smoking is a dose-dependent risk factor, so the risk increases with increasing doses **[6]**. However, the amount of tobacco consumed is not taken into account in the calculations since the model is based on information from cohort studies where such information is not available. \n",
    "\n",
    "9. Glucocorticoids\n",
    "\n",
    "It´s binary factor, yes or not. As in the case of tobacco, the dose consumed is not taken into account in the calculations. However, there is a dose-risk relationship. **[7], [8]**\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Rheumatoid arthritis\n",
    "\n",
    "It´s binary factor, yes or not. A factor that has importance on the risk of osteoporotic fracture. Increased prevalence of osteoporosis 2 times even in populations with younger ranges than FRAX. **[9]** Diagnosed rheumatoid arthritis carries a higher risk of fracture than indicated by BMD alone. **[8]**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "11. Secondary osteoporosis\n",
    "\n",
    "It´s binary factor, yes or not. Secondary osteoporisis include disorder strongly associated with osteoporosis: diabetes type I (insulin dependent), osteogenesis imperfecta in adults, untreated long-standing hyperthyroidism, hypogonadism or premature menopause (<45 years), chronic malnutrition, or malabsorption and chronic liver disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "12. Alcohol\n",
    "\n",
    "It´s binary factor, yes if the patient takes 3 or more units of alcohol daily. A unit of alcohol varies slightly in different countries from 8-10g of alcohol. This is equivalent to a standard glass of beer (285ml), a single measure of spirits (30ml), a medium-sized glass of wine (120ml), or 1 measure of an aperitif (60ml). The amount of alcohol consumed is not taken into account. However, the risk steadily increased with higher intake of alcohol. **[10]**\n",

For probability distributions and normalized histograms, it reduces to the **Wasserstein metric**. Is a measure of the distance between two probability distributions in a given region.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multidimensional distributions are used in the description of features of an image. Due to this, the EMD is especially useful in measuring the similarity of two images with respect to their color and texture.\n",
    "\n",
    "To optimize processing time, the original distribution is converted to compressed distribution. In practice with images, compressing a multidimensional distribution is achieved using histograms.\n",
    "A histogram of a grayscale image is a graphical representation of the distribution of tones in the image. It is a plot with pixel values ranging from 0 to 255 in X-axis and corresponding number of pixels in the image on Y-axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The distance between two grayscale images can be calculated using the Earth mover´s distance. Intuitively, if each distribution is viewed as a unit amount of earth (soil) piled on $D$, the metric is the minimum amount of work of turning one pile into the other, which is assumed to be the amount of earth that needs to be moved times the mean distance it has to be moved.\n",
    "\n",
    "The EMD is based on solving a transportation problem using *linear programming*. Let be a set of points in $\\mathbb{R}^d$ with $d$ the dimension. These points are grouped in order to be represented in terms of clusters. Thus, each cluster is a single point in $\\mathbb{R}^d$ and the weight of the cluster is decided by the fraction of the distribution present in that cluster. This representation of a distribution by a set of clusters is called the *Signature*. So a histogram can be interpreted as a signature.\n",

However, some FRAX studies used the distal forearm bone. The method should be tested, but in principle there should be no restriction for its correct operation."

    "The objective of the FRAX calculation tool is to determine the 10-year probability for individuals between 40 and 90 years old of experiencing an osteoporotic fracture or a hip fracture. It is concluded that FRAX is a fairly accurate application being based on international cohorts and externally validated provides high-quality data, resulting in reliable fracture probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the questionnaire has limitations and could be subject to improvement. This projec propose an improvement introducing a new specific risk factor which is a series of patient X-ray images. \n",
    "\n",
    "The programming language used in this model was Python. There are functions already created in the cv2 library, such as the Wasserstein distance, which is an approximation of the EMD. \n",
    "In this project, the decision was made to use the mathematical definition of the Earth Movers Distance for the creation of the improvement algorithm for two reasons. The first is that it is a project focused on mathematics and the second is that for medical diagnosis it is more reasonable to use a more exact model and not an approximation like is the Wasserstein distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the X-ray factor, there are other future lines of research to obtain a more precise fracture probability. For example, the inclusion of more generic factors in the questionnaire that influence the estimates of the risk functions for fracture. Variables such as the patient's physical exercise, nutrition or whether to consume calcium and vitamin D supplements or sun exposure could be taken into account.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moderate sport prevents, especially work with loads, helps to strengthen the bone and prevents its loss, especially after the age of 40 and therefore reduces the risk of fracture. However, excessive sport and risky sports can increase the risk of fracture.\n",
    "\n",
    "A varied diet based on whole vegetables is key to preventing fractures. However, there are different controversies about consume of calcium. For example, in the UK the adult recommendation is 700mg per day, but in the US it is 1200mg per day. These discrepancies are a clear sign of intentional bias. The dairy industry has a lot of economic influence in the development of milk studies.\n",
    "\n",
    "In populations that are not deficient in calcium or vitamin D, supplementation has no influence. The preventive prescription of supplements could even be harmful. When the subjects took calcium supplements, their risk of hip fractures was not reduced, but may have been increased. In fact, randomized controlled trials suggest a 64% increased risk of hip fractures with calcium supplementation compared to the placebo pill.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the future, this model in which it is proposed to compare x-ray images can be replaced with the use of **ultrasound**. The validity in musculoskeletal ultrasound is well proven and technological advances in recent years have made both the devices and the images substantially improve. Ultrasound has many advantages over radiographs since it is a cheaper, more available, more accessible, more innocuous and dynamic imaging technique.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, it should be noted that this model **will not be valid** for the use of patients who are receiving therapies that can reverse bone loss, such as hormone and anabolic therapies. The EMD measures the difference of images. The algoritm is not able to differentiate if the image changes have a positive or negative interpretation."
