    "This chapter introduces the different backgrounds and motivations to develop this final project.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bone fractures** are a major public health problem. Hip fracture is one of the most important causes of morbidity and mortality in elderly patients and is a challenge for health systems worldwide, both due to its frequency and its high economic cost. The mortality after the hip fracture during the first year after the facture is around 19%.**[1]** The epidemiological data varies between countries, but it is globally estimated that hip fractures will affect around 18% of women and 6% of men.\n",
    "Hip fractures are a major public health problem, the global number is expected to increase from 1.26 million in 1990 to 4.5 million by the year 2050. For example, only for U.S. Hip fracture represents a substantial economic burden to health-care system, accounting for $5.96 billion per year. This cost is expected to triplicate for the next 20 years.**[2]**\n",
    "\n",
    "Early identification of patients at higher risk of suffering a fracture is essential to prevent its occurrence. \n",
    "To do this, different tools are designed based on mathematical algorithms to assess the risk of fracture that feed different patient data. For example, *FRAX®*, *QFracture®*, Canadian Osteoporosis Society, the Nguyen algorithm and the Dutch algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Osteoporosis** weakens bones to the point that they can break easily. It is called a “silent disease” because people who develop it may not notice any changes until a bone breaks — usually a bone in the hip, spine, or wrist. While people of all races and ethnic groups can develop osteoporosis, certain groups are more likely to develop the disease. \n",
    "It is a disease linked to aging, which affects about one in five women and one in twenty men, over age of 50.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bone Mineral Density(BMD)** is used as an **indirect indicator** of osteoporosis and fracture risk. BDM is the amount of bone mineral in bone tissue. The concept is of mass of mineral per volume of bone (relating to density in the physics sense), although clinically it is measured by proxy according to optical density per square centimetre of bone surface upon imaging. The most commonly used BMD test is called a **central dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry**(**DXA**). Bone mineral density could help prevent fractures, allowing the diagnosis of osteoporosis before a fracture event occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the imperfect capture of risk with BMD alone poses several problems for the clinical assessment of fracture risk.\n",
    "The performance characteristics of the test are less than optimal in terms of the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity. \n",
    "The osteoporotic fractures affect a substantial minority of the population, so based only on BDM detection, sensivity is low. \n",
    "For example, the annual incidence of hip fracture increases approximately 30 times between the ages of 50 and 90, however considering only the bone mineral density basis, studies expect an increase of only 4 times. **[3]**\n",
    "Another big disadvantage of BMD is its high cost. There are many countries that currently do not have such a device widely distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the difficulties presented by the BMD determination test itself, other tools emerge considering more independent risk factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main objective of this work is try to improve the *FRAX* tool, increasing its probability accuracy through an algorithm that analyzes a series of additional radiographs of patients."

    "*FRAX* is an *on-line* tool which calculates the risk of fracture from a number of clinical risk factors, whether bone mineral density is known or not. It is probably the most internationally recognized method for determining fracture risk, thanks to the quality of the data used on its methodology and calculations. \n",
    "\n",
    "This *FRAX* model has been validated in 11 study cohorts across the world. The application computes the probability of both hip fracture and the most important osteoporotic fractures at a 10-year span (spinal, forearm, shoulder, or hip clinic).\n",

    "*FRAX*  is not an infallible tool and it does have its **limitations**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It should be noted that the Body Mineral Density on its own is not an accurate method for predicting osteoporotic fractures, but *FRAX* works better if the BMD is known. \n",
    "- Other example could be the **Body Mass Index** $ BMI = \\frac{mass(kg)} {height(m)^2} $ which may be altered in patients with high muscular development (BMI increases, the risk may be overestimated) or by decreased height in patients due to vertebral fractures. In these patients, the risk may be underestimated (worst possible scenario). "

    "Bone mineral density, as a risk factor of the *FRAX* algorithm, is evaluated in the *femoral neck* by DXA, but\n",
    "there are a few cohort studies where DXA was used on the *distal forearm*. As mentioned in the previous section, *FRAX* may or may not count on the BMD value.

    "As previously mentioned, having BMD alone is insufficient to identify all individuals under risk of fracture, since these fractures affect a minority of the population (low sensitivity). On the other hand, it should be noted that obtaining a T-Score > 1,5 SD does not guarantee not suffering a fracture. Therefore, to better estimate the risk there is a need to take into consideration a wider range of risk factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Age\n",
    "\n",
    "The model accepts ages between 40 and 90 years. If ages below or above are entered, the programme will compute probabilities at 40 and 90 years old, respectively. The increase in risk with increasing age can vary up to 4 times when compared to BMD alone**[3]**.\n",

    "\n",
    "6. Previous fracture\n",

    "\n",
    "It is a binary factor, yes or not depending on whether the patient currently smokes tobacco.

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "12. Alcohol\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a binary factor, yes if the patient takes 3 or more units of alcohol daily. A unit of alcohol varies slightly in different countries from 8-10g of alcohol. This is equivalent to a standard glass of beer (285ml), a single measure of spirits (30ml), a medium-sized glass of wine (120ml), or 1 measure of an aperitif (60ml).

It is concluded that *FRAX* is a fairly accurate application being based on international cohorts and externally validated provides high-quality data, resulting in reliable fracture probabilities.\n",

    "The programming language used in this model was Python. There are functions already created in the cv2 library, such as the Wasserstein distance, which is an approximation of the EMD. \n",
    "In this project, the decision was made to use the mathematical definition of the Earth Movers Distance for the creation of the improvement algorithm because this project is focused on mathematics.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the X-ray factor, there are other future lines of research to obtain a more precise fracture probability. For example, the inclusion of more generic factors in the questionnaire that influence the estimates of the risk functions for fracture. Variables such as the patient's physical exercise, nutrition or whether they consume calcium and vitamin D supplements or sun exposure could be taken into account.\n",
    "\n",
    "Practicing sports in moderation is also a prevention method, especially when working with weights, since it helps strengthen bone mass and prevents bone loss, especially notably after the age of 40, and therefore reduces the risk of fracture.**[12]** However, excessive sport and risky sports can increase the risk of fracture.\n",
    "\n",
    "A varied diet based on whole vegetables is key to preventing fractures. However, there are different controversies about the consumption of calcium. For example, in the UK the adult recommendation is 700mg per day, but in the US it is 1200mg per day. These discrepancies are a clear sign of intentional bias. The dairy industry holds a high economic influence in the development of milk studies. However, it seems that studies that do not declare conflict of interest can´t associate dairy products intake with a lower risk of osteoporosis and hip fracture. **[13]**\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, populations that are not deficient in calcium or vitamin D, supplementation has no influence. The preventive prescription of supplements could even be harmful. **[14]** In several studies, when the subjects took calcium supplements, their risk of hip fractures was not reduced, but may have been increased. In fact, randomized controlled trials suggest a 64% increased risk of hip fractures with calcium supplementation compared to the placebo pill.**[15]**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the future, this model in which it is proposed to compare x-ray images can be replaced with the use of **Quantitative ultrasound (QUS)**. The validity in musculoskeletal ultrasound is well proven and technological advances in recent years have made both the devices and the images substantially improve. **[16]** Ultrasound has many advantages over radiographs since it is a cheaper, more available, more accessible, more innocuous and dynamic imaging technique.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, it should be noted that this model **will not be valid for the use with patients who are receiving therapies that could reverse bone loss**, such as hormone and anabolic therapies. The EMD measures the difference of images. The algoritm is not able to differentiate if the image changes have a positive or negative interpretation."
